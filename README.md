Serpent
=======
Transforms your python code into a serpent and sword!

###Technical

- Runs on mac and most verisons of linux
- Tested on python 2.7 but may work with 3.x

###Example

The file below would compile and run if I didn't truncate the sword to fit on the page. (lawl)

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import serpent

Your sword will be muuccccccchhhh longer than this. I'm working on it
"""
```

###How to use

- Just import serpent.py at the top of your file

```
import serpent
```

- Then write some code

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import serpent

print "hello world"
```

- Compile your file

```
python some.file.py
```

- Open the newly generated serpent file that's extrememly freaking long and totally wasting space but who cares it's a kickass snake wrapped around a kickass sword!!

#### Compile that wild file, child.

```
python some.file.ss.py
```

##Something to note:

The purpose of this file is not to compress your code. In fact this will make your files larger. much, much larger. This is simply intended to amuse you.
